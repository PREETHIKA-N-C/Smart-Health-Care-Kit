# Smart-Health-Care-Kit
Smart Health care kit records the patient heartbeat rate and body temperature and furthermore sends an email/SMS alert whenever those readings go beyond critical values. Pulse rate and body temperature readings are recorded over ThingSpeak and Google sheets with the goal that patient health can be observed from any place on the world over the web. A buzzer is also be attached so that patients can press it in an emergency to send an email/SMS to their relatives.

Components Used:
      1) Arduino Uno and Programming Cable
      2) ESP8266 Wi-Fi module
      3) Pulse rate sensor
      4) Push button
      5) LM35 temperature sensor
      6) Male-female wires
      7) Breadboard
      8) 10k Resistor

Technology Used: IOT

Software Platforms Used: Thingspeak and IFTTT
